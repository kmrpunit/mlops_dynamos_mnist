#  Handwritten Digit Recognition
Implement Enseble Model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

# Instruction
1. Create a ML model by selecting any 1 of the above mentioned usecase. 
Students can choose any algorithm and approach to build it. "
2. Use hyper-parameter tuning techniuque to find the best model and log all experiment run using ML-Flow
3. Create a Docker container for the Backed API and push it to docker hub

# Eval Criteria
1. REST API for best_model_parameter[method to be used GET], prediction[ method to be used POST] and training[ method to be used POST]
2. Experiment artifact should be visible in the code github repository
3. A working Docker Image of your application showcasing both the ML-flow UI and the REST API

# Guidelines
1. Students have to form a team of not more than 4 person. Single person team not recommended (have to take prior approval).
2. Project team should use a single github repositroy for collaboaration.
3. Each member should have a valid commit history of there contribution to the code repository. Any member who has no contribution will not be graded.
4. Please do not copy code from ChatGPT.
5. AVOID pushing dataset to GitHub repo.

# Final Deliverable:
* A GitHub repository with:
* The ML model code.
* Hyperparameter tuning implementation.
* MLflow tracking integration.
* A Flask/FastAPI application serving the model.
* A Dockerfile for deployment.
* A working Docker container running the complete ML pipeline.# mlops_dynamos_mnist
